			<h2>
				Hellfire Shotguns (Weapon)
			</h2>
			<p>
				Reaper's primary weapon. The primary fire will cause Reaper to alternate shooting his two shotguns. These shotguns have a wide spread and deal high damage at short range, but have high damage falloff past that range.
			</p>

			<h2>
				The Reaping (Passive)
			</h2>
			<p>
				Whenever Reaper eliminates an enemy, they spawn a red Soul Globe near their body, which Reaper can walk on top of to restore 50 Health. 
			</p>

			<h2>
				Wraith Form (L Shift)
			</h2>
			<p>
				When activated, Reaper assumes a gaseous purple form for a short period of time. While in this form, he is invincible and untargetable by any enemy weapons or abilities and ignores enemy collision. He also moves faster for the duration. However, he cannot attack or use any abilities during this time.
			</p>
			<img src="../IMG/AbilityIcons/shadow-step.png" />
			<h2>
				Shadow Step (E)
			</h2>
			<p>
				When activated, Reaper will switch to a targeting mode, allowing him to select a point within his line of sight to Shadow Step to. Once he finds a suitable point, he can press the primary fire button to teleport to the target location after a short delay.
			</p>
			<img src="../IMG/AbilityIcons/death-blossom.png" />
			<h2>
				Death Blossom (Q)
			</h2>
			<p>
				Reaper's Ultimate ability. When activated, Reaper begins to fire his shotguns in a large AoE around himself, dealing significant damage to all nearby enemies that are within his line of sight for a short period of time. His movement speed is slowed for the duration, and he cannot use normal attacks or abilities. This is a channeled ability, and stuns will immediately end Death Blossom's effect.
