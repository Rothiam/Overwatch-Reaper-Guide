				General Strategy
			</h2>
			<p>
				Reaper is not a straightforward engager hero like most of the other Offense Heroes. In general, Reaper looks to take out tanks and squishies alike from sneaky positions using Shadow Step, then disengaging with Wraith Form, or continuing the assault with Death Blossom. Reaper can be devastating in teamfights with his Ultimate, but the general Reaper strategy is to go solo and pick off who you can.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Specific Gamemodes
			</h2>
			<h2>
				Escort
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Maps: Watchpoint Gibraltar, Dorado, Route 66
			</h4>
			<p>
				Both sides of escort are Reaper's weakest gamemodes. However, you can still have significant impact. When pushing, sneak behind enemy lines and take out snipers, because there are guaranteed to be some. When defending, hide in corners until the car passes, and then unload on the unsuspecting enemies who were foolish enough to push.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Assault
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Maps: Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, Volskaya Industries
			</h4>
			<p>
				On offense, Reaper looks to sneak behind with Shadow Step and pick off snipers or supports and then Wraith Form out of danger. Continue this cycle until your team is able to overrun the abandoned enemy offense and tanks.
				Reaper is not recommended for defense in any scenario, but if you're a stubborn Reaper fan like I am, you can make it work. Hide behind corners, let the tanks pass, and then take out the squishies before retreating to the shadows.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Control
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Maps: Lijiang Tower, Nepal, Ilios
			</h4>
			<p>
				Reaper shines in control maps. If you own the point, he can sneak around, taking out attackers, since they are usually scattered. If you do not own the point, all the enemies will be stacked, allowed for easy flanking and Death Blossoms.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Hybrid
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Maps: King's Row, Numbani, Hollywood
			</h4>
			<p>
				As of now, the only hybrid gamemode in the game is a mix of Assault followed by Escort. Therefore, use the Assault and Escort strategies respectively depending on what stage of the game you are in.
