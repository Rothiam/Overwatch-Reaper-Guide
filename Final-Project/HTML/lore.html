				Reyes during the Omnic Crisis
				The man who would later be known as Reaper was originally known as Gabriel Reyes. He was born in Los Angeles. Prior to the Omnic Crisis, he joined the United States military, where he achieved a senior officer position. He achieved veteran status, and was highly respected. At some point he met John Morrison, a fellow soldier, and the two became friends. Subsequently, in the midst of the Omnic Crisis, they joined Overwatch togetherâ€”a small, elite taskforce created by the United Nations to deal with the omnic threat. Reyes was given leadership of the group. Overwatch succeeded in defeating the omnics. Morrison, who had played a key role in shaping the group, was given the position of strike commander, acting as the first, official commanding officer of Overwatch. Reyes was passed over in the process, which created a rift between the two men. At some point, Reyes was part of Overwatch's Blackwatch unit. As time went on, the tension between Reyes and Morrison worsened. Overwatch met its end through a combination of accusations that tainted the organization's reputation, and Reyes himself. Officially, Reyes and Morrison were killed in the blast that destroyed Overwatch's Swiss headquarters, an event the UN ruled as an accident. In reality, Overwatch had become split down the middle, with Reyes leading a rebellion against Morrison's leadership. As a battle was waged within the base, their fighting triggered an explosion that destroyed the facility, and apparently took Reyes and Morrison into the inferno with it. To this day, Reyes's true agenda remains unknown.

				Reaper
			</h3>
			<p>
				Reyes resurfaced as a volatile mercenary known as "Reaper." His identity and motives remained unknown. Now a ruthless and remorseless killer, he was responsible for terrorist attacks throughout the world. He fought in many armed conflicts over the decades, showing no loyalty to any cause or organization. Survivors described him as a black shadow ghosting unscathed through the most hellish battlefields. The few bodies recovered of his victims were pale, empty husks drained of life, their cells showing signs of intense degradation. It was speculated that Reaper was a byproduct of failed genetic alteration which forced his cells to simultaneously decay and regenerate at a hyper-accelerated rate. Those attempting to track his movements began to see a pattern in his appearances. They believed that Reaper was hunting former Overwatch agents and systematically eliminating them.
